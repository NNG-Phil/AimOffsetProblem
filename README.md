# AimOffsetProblem
 
This is a sample project that conatains a proof of concept for our character, skeleton, blueprint, animation blueprint, and needed animations. We are trying to tie them all together so playing feels like a natural over the shoulder 3rd person shooter. We are having an issue with the calculation of Yaw rotation when aiming weapons relative to the character's position as well as any bone transformations that need to occur.

# Reference Videos

Example of our yaw not facing the direction of the camera as the lower body rotation negatively affects the upper body rotation.

Example of another project using an Animation system we can't use that seems to have solved this problem.
